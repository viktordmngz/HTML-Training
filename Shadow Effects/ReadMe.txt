This is a practice page for learning the box and text shadow techniques in CSS.
I also used this as a way to practice making pricing cards.

Currently, the project is not yet complete as the pricing cards are not behaving correctly. Hoping to fix these issues or have someone help me.

Here is a link to the codepen: https://codepen.io/viktordmngz/pen/XWvLRpO

  <h1>Practicing With Divs</h1>
  <p>This is not contained in a div.</p>
  <div id="borderdiv">This is a div.</div>
  <pre>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur, adipisicing elit. Expedita earum tenetur tempore aut doloremque deserunt dignissimos quibusdam nihil impedit laudantium tempora exercitationem aliquid, eveniet id autem rerum ipsam sequi officiis?
This is an example of an <span id="borderspan">inline element.</span>
Notice that the div element is a block element and takes the full width of the screen.
The span element only takes up the necessary width.
Now, let's look at how to use the div element to format our pages.</pre>
  
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Using Divs to align elements</h2>

  <h3 style="text-align: center;">Float Method</h3>
  <div id="floatdiv">
    <div style="background-color: bisque;">
      <h3 style="text-align: center;">Florida</h3>
      <p>
        Florida's capital is Tallahassee.
      </p>
        <p>Florida is located as south of Georgia and Alabama, to the east of the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
    </div>

    <div style="background-color: lightsalmon;">
      <h3 style="text-align: center;">Maine</h3>
      <p>Maine contains the eastmost point in the USA, a point that is closer to Africa than Miami!</p>
      <p>Maine contains the eastmost point in the USA, a point that is closer to Africa than Miami!</p>
      <p>Maine also contains the northernmost point in the contiguous USA. How neat!</p>
    </div>

    <div style="background-color: lightskyblue;">
      <h3 style="text-align: center;">Texas</h3>
      <p>The largest state in the contiguous US, Texas used to be its own country!</p>
      <p>Texas used to contain parts of New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Colorado.</p>
    </div>

  </div>
  <p>The float method is able to align the elements without overlapping each other.</p>
  <p>Notice how the blocks are able to take on different heights but align at the top and have no gaps.</p>
  <p>However, float divs must be done in two steps: one to set the width of the parent container and one to set the width of the child blocks.</p>
  <br>
  <br>


  <h3 style="text-align: center;">Inline-block Method</h3>
  <div id="inlinediv">
    <div style="background-color: bisque;">
      <h3 style="text-align: center;">Florida</h3>
      <p>
        Florida's capital is Tallahassee.
      </p>
        <p>Florida is located as south of Georgia and Alabama, to the east of the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
    </div>

    <div style="background-color: lightsalmon;">
      <h3 style="text-align: center;">Maine</h3>
      <p>Maine contains the eastmost point in the USA, a point that is closer to Africa than Miami!</p>
      <p>Maine contains the eastmost point in the USA, a point that is closer to Africa than Miami!</p>
      <p>Maine also contains the northernmost point in the contiguous USA. How neat!</p>
    </div>

    <div style="background-color: lightskyblue;">
      <h3 style="text-align: center;">Texas</h3>
      <p>The largest state in the contiguous US, Texas used to be its own country!</p>
      <p>Texas used to contain parts of New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Colorado.</p>
    </div>

  </div>
  <p>The inline block method can also take on different heights, but will use the same width for each block.</p>
  <p>There is a gap between each block. Notice that the blocks line up at the bottom.</p>
  <p>This method only needs to use a set width and display method on the interior div containers.</p>
  <br>
  <br>


  <h3 style="text-align: center;">Flex Method</h3>
  <div id="flexdiv">
    <div style="background-color: bisque;">
      <h3 style="text-align: center;">Florida</h3>
      <p>
        Florida's capital is Tallahassee.
      </p>
        <p>Florida is located as south of Georgia and Alabama, to the east of the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
    </div>

    <div style="background-color: lightsalmon;">
      <h3 style="text-align: center;">Maine</h3>
      <p>Maine contains the eastmost point in the USA, a point that is closer to Africa than Miami!</p>
      <p>Maine contains the eastmost point in the USA, a point that is closer to Africa than Miami!</p>
      <p>Maine also contains the northernmost point in the contiguous USA. How neat!</p>
    </div>

    <div style="background-color: lightskyblue;">
      <h3 style="text-align: center;">Texas</h3>
      <p>The largest state in the contiguous US, Texas used to be its own country!</p>
      <p>Texas used to contain parts of New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Colorado.</p>
    </div>

  </div>
  <p>The easiest of these methods. This will set the widths and heights of the blocks automatically (will be the same for each block).</p>
  <p>The flex method combines the float method and the inline-block method together.</p>
  <p>Only need to call the display styling on the parent container.</p>
  <br>
  <br>


  <h3 style="text-align: center;">Grid Method</h3>
  <div id="griddiv">
    <div style="background-color: bisque;">
      <h3 style="text-align: center;">Florida</h3>
      <p>
        Florida's capital is Tallahassee.
      </p>
        <p>Florida is located as south of Georgia and Alabama, to the east of the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
    </div>

    <div style="background-color: lightsalmon;">
      <h3 style="text-align: center;">Maine</h3>
      <p>Maine contains the eastmost point in the USA, a point that is closer to Africa than Miami!</p>
      <p>Maine contains the eastmost point in the USA, a point that is closer to Africa than Miami!</p>
      <p>Maine also contains the northernmost point in the contiguous USA. How neat!</p>
    </div>

    <div style="background-color: lightskyblue;">
      <h3 style="text-align: center;">Texas</h3>
      <p>The largest state in the contiguous US, Texas used to be its own country!</p>
      <p>Texas used to contain parts of New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Colorado.</p>
    </div>

  </div>
  <p>The grid method is similar to the Flex in that it sets the height, but the width is set by the user.</p>
  <p>The grid method can be used when you want to use different widths on your blocks.</p>
  <p>This can be useful when some blocks contain more information than others.</p>
